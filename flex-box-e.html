<!-- CSS flex box, a new part on CSS3 that allows you to create complex and flexible layouts just using css. Before flex box we used to have to use floats, varible hights as well as any number of hacks to get your project to work smoothle, eseically when using responsive design  -->

<!-- flex box doesn't just apply to one element, you will need to apply certain property values to the FLEX BOX / FLEX CONTAINER (the wrapper in this case) And certain property values to the child called FLEX ITEM (the boxes in this case) -->
